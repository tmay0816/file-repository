Description:

This ruby code performs both a positive and a negative test case on
a basic web form. The positive case supplies all required fields 
while the negative test case does not. The positive test case performs
a successful submit while the negative one triggers validation messages
and remains on the same page. The title of the page was used to determine 
if it transitioned to the next page successfully or not.

Here are the results of the tests from the command line.
